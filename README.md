my dataset consist of two columns experience and salary
i consider salary as y coordinate and experience as x coordinate 
in my dataset i take upto 24 values for training and 6 for testing you choose yourself
for testing you can even use your own dataset 
after splitting training and testing i implement linearregression method to calculate the fields i have selected.
